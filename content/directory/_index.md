If I'm going to keep claiming that blogs are the best social media, they have to have some "social" aspect beyond me shouting my ideas into the void. I'm currently using this area to promote friends' projects. If you stumbled on my blog, you might also like what these people have to say.

This is a list of people I personally know, like, and whose stuff I want to share. For a more complete list of things I follow online, see [my RSS feed](https://github.com/joachimkennedy/dotconfig/blob/main/dot_config/newsboat/urls).

(If I've listed your site here and you'd like me to remove it, let me know.)

* [Neotoma's Midden](https://neotoma.site/) ([rss](https://neotoma.site/index.xml)) is your older cousin and weird internet curator
* [Dom](https://www.dominicmkennedy.com/music) ([rss](https://www.dominicmkennedy.com/music/rss.xml)) is my actual younger brother who has started reviewing albums ~~weekly~~. He's a hater, but I still support the project and am excited to learn about more music.
* [Sophie's Close Friends](https://closefriends.substack.com/) ([rss](https://closefriends.substack.com/feed)) are privy to her thoughts on herself, the zeitgeist, and readers' hot gossip. Straight from the most tapped-in culture writer herself
* [Maggie](https://magdalenekennedy.com/)'s site is not a blog, but it has very cool animations and photography
* [Leo](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14884959/leobkenn) writes fanfictions about Don Karnage and Megavolt among many others
* [August](https://augustlamm.substack.com/) ([rss](https://augustlamm.substack.com/feed)) (stealing my sister's friend here) lives a semi-itinerant artist's life
