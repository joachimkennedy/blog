If I'm going to keep claiming that blogs are the best social media, they have to have some "social" aspect beyond me shouting my ideas into the void. I'm currently using this area to promote friends' projects. If you stumbled on my blog, you might also like what these people have to say.

* [Neotoma's Midden](https://neotoma.site/) is your weird older (not actual) cousin who teaches philosophy and shares strange things he trawled from the internet
* [Dom](https://www.dominicmkennedy.com/music) is my actual younger brother who has started reviewing albums weekly. He's a hater, but I still support the project and am excited to learn about more music and plan to hold him to this
* [Sophie's Close Friends](https://closefriends.substack.com/) are privy to her thoughts on herself, the zeitgeist, and readers' hot gossip. Straight from the most tapped-in culture writer herself
* [Maggie](https://magdalenekennedy.com/)'s site is not a blog, but it has very cool animations and photography
