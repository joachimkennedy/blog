'Tis the season for the online community survey!
Everyone seems to do this these days (last New Years Eve, I even received a survey from a girl I dated that year), and I wouldn't want to miss out on the fun just for a lack of readers.
I don't track analytics on my blog, so aside from my two friends who tell me after they read every post, I have very little idea how much traffic my site gets.
I could just add analytics (and maybe I will), but I thought this would be more fun.
Analytics can't give me movie recs, but you can!

I haven't yet decided how I'll use these results.
I'm just collecting them not because I'm a nosy, opportunistic egotist.
If I do release them, they will either be aggregated (i.e. Here's everyone's non-identifying life advice) or I'll ask permission to use a particular response (if you include contact info).
All the questions are optional, so answer only what you want to.

I'm probably forgetting lots of important details, but I don't want this preamble to be too long. I wish you both much happiness in the New Year, and thank you for reading and taking this [survey](https://forms.gle/zyGxuhfnA8dAiZJL6)!
