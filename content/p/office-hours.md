*tl;dr: If you're in Seattle, come hang out at my apartment [sometimes](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MWFmZDZhZmUwNmZmNjhjMTFjOGYzMjVmNjMyMTNjNjM5ZTRlYTlkZjNlMDQ4NDJhYzkwNWU5YzUzMTE4YTIzMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).*

One of my favorite parts of college was that I could walk into my suite kitchen for a glass of water and get caught in a conversation with whoever was working there.
Or I could read in the floor lounge (flounge, affectionately) while other people beat some RPG.
Nowadays, if I'm hanging out alone in my 1BR, there's a much smaller chance that someone will ask if I want to drop super bouncy balls down the center of the stairwell.

As much as I enjoy [being alone](https://www.ankit.fyi/being-alone) and joke about having good hermit potential, I actually do like seeing people (especially if I told you it was nice to see you. I wasn't lying).
It's the part leading up to seeing people that I hate.
Everything from "hm. I haven't seen X in a while," through the [delicate scheduling dance](../wherever) right up to whenever the last acceptable moment to cancel is. Scheduling puts a lot of pressure on the engagement to be better than the next best alternative (whatever shows you're each currently watching).

I know the normal solution is going to periodic events.
This is what I do, and it works really well.
I always looked forward to bowling league in Madison, and I'm grateful that it made me spend more time with my friends there than I would have intentionally scheduled.
And it lowered the activation energy to schedule trips that we probably wouldn't have otherwise.
Now most of the people I see, I see because I go someplace at the same time each week to do the same activity.
But I can't realistically maintain all my (countless) friendships just by going to trivia nights (even though there're more than enough in Seattle and I *do* have a type).

I've long been enamored of unconventional social events like [Trampoline Hall](https://shows.acast.com/trampolinehall/episodes/amylangstaff-etiquette), the amateur barroom lecture series, or any of Misha Glouberman's many experimental off-shoot events.
Even the uber pretentious-sounding [junto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7GBQMdD6Yg) intrigues me if only because of how unusual it is to have such explicit rules.
(I don't actually listen to many podcasts; they're just all about the same thing).
(Incidentally, I also think of podcasts as unconventional social events.
It's unusual to have preplanned notes or recurring segments in normal conversations with friends).
Oops, I accidentally put one of my main points in parentheses.
    The farther you wander from the Schelling points of parties, grabbing drinks, and going to shows, the more it's incumbent on you to set clear rules and expectations.
And nothing says Good Life like an ever-increasingly elaborate scaffolding of rules to trick myself into doing everything I wanted to do in the first place.

This event is called Office Hours, after my collegiate inspiration.
I have created a calendar of times when I'll be in my apartment doing my own thing when others are welcome to show up, and do their own thing in my company.
I won't be put out if no one shows up because I'll be working on my own things.

### What to Expect

I'm not sure! I want to emphasize that this is experimental.
My sister likened the idea to "[Victorian visiting hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Home_day)".
That said, my vision is that people will come over and do normally solitary activities together in the same room.
That part is really up to you.
I will probably be reading or writing.
Feel free to bring laptops for work or watching your current show (my wifi usually works), a side project, book, knitting, geography flash cards(?)
Probably many more things that I'm not thinking of.

Come for the whole time or a part.
You can't be late (unless you show up after it's over).
It's not an "event".
It's just a time I'm committing to being home and ready to host.
I'll make an effort to have something to eat, but I can't promise it won't be cornichons, olives, and stinky cheeses.
You don't have to bring anything to eat, and even if you do, you don't have to share.

But if you don't bring something to entertain yourself, don't expect me to entertain you.
I do have a small library and I'll probably get a *New Yorker* subscription.
Otherwise, who knows, I might try to teach you to juggle, pressure you into a chess game, or make you help me cook dinner.

One person has already expressed interest, so unless that's you, it probably won't just be the two of us.
I intend to share this with many people in Seattle with the expectation that most people won't show up most of the time.
My apartment can fit 4 comfortably and up to 8 uncomfortably.

I am trying to be comprehensive, but I always forget very important things, so I'll add an appendix for any major changes.

### Logistics

* The [schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MWFmZDZhZmUwNmZmNjhjMTFjOGYzMjVmNjMyMTNjNjM5ZTRlYTlkZjNlMDQ4NDJhYzkwNWU5YzUzMTE4YTIzMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), currently Mondays 7:30 - 9:30 PM but subject to change at my slightest whim, so do check first
  * This is poorly timed because I like to be outside whenever the weather is nice, but I also go to bed early, so I don't know what will happen as the days get longer
* No need to RSVP
* Near stops for the 5, 44, 62, and E buses and there's usually free street parking within a block
  * I'm not sure where the nearest bike rack is. It's probably close, but you might be able to bring your bike inside if you need to
* Email for the exact address and which bell inexplicably rings my apartment (or more likely my number so you can call when you arrive)
* My internet is about 30 mbps down except for sometimes where it stops working for a few seconds
