This weekend, on my morning run, I saw someone riding a bike with a cat on their shoulder.

When I was thinking about moving out of Madison (link to old post), I knew I wanted a bigger city, but I wasn't sure exactly why.
My best guess had to do with better restaurants and public transit.
When I doubted myself, I thought I just like college and was trying to recreate that environment in vain.
Once on a visit to Milwaukee, I even considered that perhaps I just found it more comforting to be surrounded by tall buildings.
Now, having moved, I think that a not insignificant factor in favor of larger cities is serendipity.

I learned about serendipity in relation to dictionaries.
When you look in a physical dictionary, looking at guide words, flipping back and forth, scanning pages, you're likely to find other interesting new words on the way to the one you originally wanted.
This is a much different experience from searching online where you only learn the definition you meant to.
But it's also different from reading the dictionary cover to cover or specifically looking for unusual words.
When you're looking for a specific word, any goods ones that you come across on the way are a bonus.
When you're looking for the most interesting word you can find, your success is capped by the best one you happen to find.

The conventional wisdom is that happiness is reality minus expectations.
The exact same party might be a pleasant surprise or a bust depending solely on whether you were dreading it or enthused.
In that framework, a serendipitous encounter is double great.
You feel great because reality exceeded your nonexistent expectations, but on top of that, you feel lucky for walking into that particular gin joint.

But all dictionaries are not created equal.
A pocket dictionary has fewer and more common words than one of those behemoths in the library with its own table and tiny font.
We might say that the latter is riper for serendipity.
Not only does it contain more words, it harder to find the one you're looking for; it takes more scanning and page-turns.

I feel the same way about cities. Not just bigger, but riper.

I think the walkable, unzoning crowd misses out on this feature.

Dictionaries have a correlation between number of words and interestingness which might not be true of cities.

Another case is when I receive an unexpected call from a friend.
It always brightens my day enough for me to overcome my anxiety and call one or two friends myself.
But it's never quite the same.
Of course they're still pleasant, and I never regret doing it, but since I know I'm about to call someone, it's never a surprise for me.
It's much better to get called than to call, but assuming symmetry (and that you're not a selfish person) you should still call to give your friend the pleasant surprise.
