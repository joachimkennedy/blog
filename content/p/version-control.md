* Clearer thinking / Intrinsic motivation
* The Great Divorce
* git commit is strangely poetic

* Writing after getting dumped

For a while now, I have wanted to write about how I dealt with a girl breaking up with me in college, but I haven't been able to think of a way to frame it that doesn't just make it sound incredibly sad.
It's a strategy or at least a rationale that I don't hear much about, and I found it tremendously helpful, so excuse me while I induce kidney damage from patting myself on the back too hard.
In any breakup, the dumper is typically better prepared.
They've already come to terms with the fact that the relationship isn't good for them however much they may care for the other person.
The dumped (me in this case) may still think the relationship was the best thing that ever happened to them and that they'll never find another fish as cool and interesting as this fish and that the best thing would be figure out some way to get back together.

I realized that I couldn't keep wallowing in self-pity, but at the same time, I never wanted to forget all the great things about this person and all the great feelings I felt for her even though they were directly the cause of all my unhappiness.

My solution was to write.
In the most indulgent way possible, I wrote all about how I was feeling.
I wrote about how I just wanted to pick up my phone and see a message from her and about all the possible reasons she might have broken up with me and about many other melodramatic things which you'll never read.
Every time I was stewing over it too much, I reopened the document and wrote about it.
(I also talked to friends; I'm not a monster).
After more words than I'd care to admit, the updates became fewer and farther between.
They became more of the flavor, "Huh, I don't feel as horrible now." or "Huh, I just realized I haven't thought about her all day."

By writing obsessively, I was able to have my cake and eat it too.
I know exactly how I felt at the time because I've written it down.
Meanwhile, the rest of myself has been able to grow and move on and do other things.

I get acute insomnia every month or so.
The infuriating thing about insomnia is not that you're not tired.
If I weren't tired, I just wouldn't sleep.
The infuriating part is that you're exhausted, but nevertheless resigned to tossing and turning like you're figuring out how to use a bed.
I'm sure there are many varied physiological explanations for insomnia, but in my subjective experience, it only ever happens when there's something stuck in my head that I would rather think about than sleep like what Christmas will be like or why that girl can't see that we're perfect together.
Or not rather.
Something I can't help myself from thinking about, like wiggling a loose tooth.

To date, the only reliable antidote I've found for insomnia is, for lack of a better word, meditation.
There are 2 steps to my method.
Step 0, which I never consciously think about, is to decide that I want to go to sleep more than I want to ruminate.
Sometimes this is not true! In that case, I've escaped insomnia through a loophole.
Now I'm lying in bed with my eyes closed kicking myself for what I totally should have said in that situation.
If I do want to sleep, then step 1 is to evacuate all thoughts from my mind.
If you don't have an inner monologue, I don't know how you would do this, but for me, it gets very quiet, like an empty room that not even you are in.
When I get to that state, I try to prolong it for as long as possible and let the wind blow through my mind while I hold my breath.
After a few seconds, I inevitably do start to notice my breath and subsequently the fact that I'm noticing, but by that point the ruminations have been supplanted by the nonsense sentences that give way to dreams.

The word "want" is insufficient in this context.
The ghosts in The Great Divorce visiting the foothills of Heaven "want" to continue their familiar, miserable existences, but some part of them also "wants" to be free of it.
Call it Id and Superego, Lizard brain and Human brain, Instant Gratification Monkey and Rational Decision-Maker, under some definitions of "want", it is possible, even banal to have competing desires.

Earlier this year, after hearing about it from an 80K Hours interview with Spencer Greenberg, the founder of clearerthinking.org, I went to take a survey on "intrinsic values".
The concept is that some values, like financial stability or--according to them--food, are only means to ends.
Intrinsic values are values that are ends in themselves, like pleasurable experiences or good things happening to people you love.
They live at that uncomfortable interface between rationalism and however normal people conceive of the world.

The quiz gave you possible values, and you had to decide whether it was an intrinsic value.
If so, you could rate how important it was to you.
Presumably, once you've figured out your top intrinsic values, you can start maximizing those and ignoring the rest.
The first potential value (right after the test making sure I really understood what an intrinsic value was) was, "That my values do not change to something different than they are right now".
Instead of answering the question, I had a breakdown that ended only because I surpassed the 20 minute estimate for the entire quiz, and I closed the tab.

If at time t0, you have some value for maximizing or maintaining x (e.g. producing original, independent music), then any other potential value that comes along (e.g. a record deal, a quiet domestic life) is a threat to that.
No true artist wants to become a sell-out; no true zealot wants to become an apostate (and no true Scotsman wants to put sugar on his porridge).
Of course, evaluated at time t1 with some new value, you may have the perspective to say, "This lucrative record deal really is the best thing for me financially" or "Yikes, she was kind of a bad person".
The most tragic aspect of The Great Divorce is that you know that if any of the characters got even the briefest glimpse of Heaven outside their messed up value systems, the choice would be trivial.
