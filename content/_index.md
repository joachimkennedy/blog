Hi! My name is Joachim Kennedy.
I'm a software engineer based in Seattle.
I enjoy running, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29740555-joachim?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/kennedyj/films/by/date/), playing chess and pickleball, wandering around, improv, karaoke, cooking, and trying new things. 

Here is my [resume](/resume-kennedy-joachim.pdf).

## Contact
If you read anything here that resonates with you, I would be delighted to hear about it at joachimkennedy [at] gmail [dot] com!

If you don't want me to know who you are, I'm also trying out an anonymous feedback form: https://www.admonymous.co/joa.

## Directory
I'm trying to help bring blogs back as the premier [social media](./p/social-media) which means that it's long overdue that I start assembling a [directory](./directory) of other blogs I like.

## Office Hours
There's a slight scheduling change for the Fall/Winter. I'm pushing them back by an hour. They're still weekly on Tuesdays, but starting from Sept 24, they'll be at 7-10PM. If you want to come, you're welcome to RSVP. If the date on the calendar says "OH [confirmed]", that means someone else has already RSVPed and you're welcome to just show up. Calendar, details, and long-winded explanation of office hours [here](../p/office-hours).
