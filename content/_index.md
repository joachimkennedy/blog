Hi! My name is Joachim Kennedy.
I am a software engineer based in Seattle.
Aside from writing words and code, I enjoy reading, running, playing chess and volleyball, exploring the city, and trying new things.

One of the primary reasons I started this blog was to invite more serendipity into my life.
If you're somehow reading this (and I don't already know it), please feel obligated to [say hi](mailto:joachimkennedy@gmail.com)!
(If you're worried about it being awkward, I can take full responsibility, but you can always ask about [movies I've watched](https://letterboxd.com/kennedyj/films/by/date/) or [books I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29740555-joachim?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read).)
