Hi! My name is Joachim Kennedy.
I'm a software engineer based in Seattle.
I enjoy running, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29740555-joachim?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/kennedyj/films/by/date/), playing chess and pickleball, wandering around, improv, karaoke, cooking, and trying new things. If you read anything here that resonates with you, I would be delighted to hear about it at (joachimkennedy [at] gmail [dot] com)!

## [Directory](./directory)
I'm trying to help bring blogs back as the premier [social media](./p/social-media) which means that it's long overdue that I start linking to other blogs I like to build up that network.

## [Office Hours](./p/office-hours)
I'm planning to bring office hours back. I originally launched them just as the weather was getting nice. I'm hoping that now that it's cold and dark, people (including me) are more open to doing things inside.

I still need to iron out my calendar a bit. I'm thinking of defaulting to Tuesday evenings after dark starting 1/30. If at least one person RSVPs for a certain day, I'll update the [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MWFmZDZhZmUwNmZmNjhjMTFjOGYzMjVmNjMyMTNjNjM5ZTRlYTlkZjNlMDQ4NDJhYzkwNWU5YzUzMTE4YTIzMUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) confirming that office hours are happening. That way, anyone else can just check the calendar and show up.
