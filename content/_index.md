Hi! My name is Joachim Kennedy.
I am a software engineer based in Seattle.
Aside from writing words and code, I enjoy reading, running, watching movies, playing chess and volleyball, wandering around, and trying new things.

This is the social media I'm most active on, and I'm shamelessly trying to convince all my friends to start blogs.
I also use [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/kennedyj/films/by/date/) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/29740555-joachim?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read).
If you're somehow reading this (and I don't already know it), please feel obligated to [say hi](mailto:joachimkennedy@gmail.com)!
